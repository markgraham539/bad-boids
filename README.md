This implementation of boids has two bird types, Boid and Eagle, implemented using inheritance of a base class, Bird. It makes use of the model-view-controller pattern; run boidsRun.py to use this (alternative, view_boids.py contains simpler visualisation code).

At the moment, none of the tests will work as they are for old code.
